Hi, maybe you want to use the data on EDC for a specific purpose? or it needs to be in a specific file format?, like in:

- Plain text
- Excel/CSV
- XML
- Markdown
- HTML
- MySQL database (sql commands)
- Graphs (png/jpg)
- Anything else (that can be done!)

I can make that data parse in the EDC manager so it can be exported for you on every EDC update!

The request can be made freely, i will not charge you for it, but... you have to work on EDC for it!

Your mission:
- Add 100 emulator versions that we do not have yet in our database! and i will create your export wish!, you can find a [walktrough here](https://github.com/PhoenixInteractiveNL/emuDownloadCenter/wiki/Collecting-walktrough)

[You can contact me here.](https://github.com/PhoenixInteractiveNL/emuDownloadCenter/wiki/Contact)

Exported data rules:
* You may not use the exported data for commercial use or benefits.
* You must place a link back to EDC.
