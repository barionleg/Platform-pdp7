Hi, maybe you want to use the data on EDC for a specific purpose? or it needs to be in a specific file format?, like in:

- Plain text
- Excel/CSV
- XML
- Markdown
- HTML
- MySQL database (sql commands)
- Graphs (png/jpg)
- Anything else (that can be done)

I can make that data parse in the EDC manager so it can be exported for you on every EDC update!

The request can be made freely, i will not charge you for it!, but...you have to work on EDC for it!

YOU add 100 emulator versions that we do not have yet in our database! and i will create your export wish!
