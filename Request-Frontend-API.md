Hi, maybe you want to use emuDownloadCenter as API for you frontend?, no problem! The only software you need on the client side is: **7zip** to extract the archive contents.

You can even use your own configuration files on EDC, Together we will see how the API can be implemented for your Frontend!

The request can be made freely, i will not charge you for it, but... you have to work on EDC for it!

Your mission (as you choose to accept it :sunglasses:):
- Add 100 emulator versions that we do not have yet in our project!, you can find a [walktrough here](https://github.com/PhoenixInteractiveNL/emuDownloadCenter/wiki/Collecting-walktrough)

API rules:
* You may not use the API for commercial use or benefits.
* You must link back to EDC or mention the source.
