## About
**Developement state:** :red_circle: Non-active (2001)

**C4PC** is a emulator for **Cybiko Classic** made by **Tim Schuerewegen aka FireFly** and has a **UNKNOWN** license.

The latest version of the emulator on EDC is **0.28 (x86)**, released on **2001-09-17**, it runs on **Windows XP,Vista,7,8,10**, you can start this emulator with **c4pc.exe**.

:warning: _**Please note:**_ This emulator **needs BIOS image(s)** to start ROM files!

_This emulator is not intended to be used to PLAY / RUN / USE, but to TEST Cybiko software with. Only experienced Cybiko software developers should use this software. The emulation is very unstable and does NOT represent the Cybiko device/games/apps in any way. Hence, many games/apps don't work, which isn't the case on a REAL Cybiko._
